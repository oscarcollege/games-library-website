            For more than two decades, Counter-Strike has offered an elite competitive experience shaped by millions of players from around the world. And now a new chapter in the history of CS: Counter-Strike 2 begins.

Counter-Strike 2 is a free upgrade to CS:GO that marks the biggest technical leap in Counter-Strike history. The game is powered by the Source 2 engine with modern, realistic and physically believable visuals, advanced networking technology, and improved workshop tools for the community.

In addition to the classic gameplay, introduced back in 1999 and focused on achieving goals, Counter-Strike 2 contains:

all-new CS Rating and revamped Premier Mode;
Global and regional leaderboards
improved and reworked maps;
flexible smoke from smoke grenades, which changes the approach to the game;
gameplay that does not depend on the frequency of ticks;
modernized visual effects and sounds;
all your CS:GO items.
