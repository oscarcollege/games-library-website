Congratulations on your new Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace! Throw your toys into your fire, and play with them as they burn. Stay warm in there. It's getting cold outside!

Burn flaming logs, screaming robots, credit cards, batteries, exploding fish, unstable nuclear devices, and tiny galaxies. An adventure that takes place almost entirely in front of a fireplace - about looking up up up out of the chimney, and the cold world just on the other side of the wall.
Key Features:
From the creators of World of Goo and Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure
100% indie - made by 3 guys, no office, no publishers, no funding
IAP Free - no spam, upselling, ads, of any sort. Just the game.
Zero Waste - short, polished, perfeccct as possible
