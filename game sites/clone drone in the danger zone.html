Features (in the game right now!)
Epic Voxel Dismemberment: In addition to looking cool, the ability to cut off body parts is central to the gameplay. Jumping on one leg is a common occurrence. Large enemies need to be cut down to size before a fatal blow can be delivered.
Sharp Sword Combat: Combat is fast and intense, putting great emphasis on movement, timing and positioning. You are never safe, as any blow can instantly kill or dismember.
Entertaining Commentary: Commentatron and Analysis-Bot provide a play-by-play of your performance and react to your activities.
Upgrade your robot: jetpack, bow, kicking, deflection, clones, armor, FIRE BREATH .
Terrifying robotic enemies that actually get pretty hard! Sword robots, bow robots, Spidertron 5000, Spidertron 6000, gigantic hammer bots. So many things to dismember.
Level Editor: Make custom levels and challenges and share them with other humans! Explore the rich Workshop library of awesome human-built levels!
Achievements! Unlock upgrades, emotes and multiplayer skins by achieving a rich variety of things!
Emotes! Do the Funky Pillar Dance, mock your foes, or flap your arms delightfully!
