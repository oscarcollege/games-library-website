Do you like automation games? Then you are in the right place!

shapez is a relaxed game in which you have to build factories for the automated production of geometric shapes. As the level increases, the shapes become more and more complex, and you have to spread out on the infinite map.

And as if that wasn't enough, you also have to produce exponentially more to satisfy the demands - the only thing that helps is scaling! While you only have to process shapes at the beginning, you will later have to color them - by extracting and mixing colors!

Buying the game on Steam gives you access to the full version, but you can also play the steam demo first and decide later!

This game has stolen my life and I don't want it back. Very chill factory game that won't let me stop making my lines more efficient.
